# Dependency injection

Application objects do not belong in the public request schema. Mark them with
`Inject[T]`; rpckit resolves them by their concrete type and passes them to
the handler.

```python
from rpckit import Inject, RpcChannel, RpcModel


class CreateTask(RpcModel):
    title: str


class TaskStore:
    async def create(self, title: str) -> int:
        return 1


tasks = RpcChannel("tasks")


@tasks.server.method()
async def create(params: CreateTask, store: Inject[TaskStore]) -> int:
    return await store.create(params.title)
```

`store` is invisible to callers and to OpenRPC. Only `CreateTask` is serialized
on the wire.

## Pass known values as context

For small applications and tests, pass an object or a type-to-value mapping to
the channel or endpoint server:

```python
store = TaskStore()
server = tasks.create_server(context={TaskStore: store})
response = await server.handle(
    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "tasks.create",
        "params": {"title": "Write docs"},
    }
)
```

A single object is registered under its concrete type. A mapping is useful
when several dependencies are needed or a value is registered against a base
class or protocol.

## Provide a resolver

A resolver implements one async method:

```python
class Resolver:
    async def resolve[T](self, dependency: type[T]) -> T: ...
```

Pass it as `resolver=` to `RpcService.serve()`, an endpoint, `create_router()`,
or `create_server()`. A synchronous or asynchronous callable taking the
requested type is accepted as a lightweight alternative.

Context values take precedence over the resolver. `RpcConnection` and, on
socket endpoints, `RpcConnectedClient` are also made available by type for the lifetime of
that connection.

## Resource scopes

Every method enters its channel's resolver scope. The default `call_scope`
looks for an optional `enter_scope()` async context manager on the resolver,
which makes request-scoped cleanup possible:

```python
channel = RpcChannel("tasks", resolver_scope=call_scope)
```

After acceptance, rpckit optionally enters the resolver's
`enter_connection()` context for the socket lifetime. Event sources live in
that connection scope; binary streams additionally enter their channel's
resolver scope.

## Dishka

Install the optional integration and wrap an async Dishka container:

```bash
uv add "pyrpckit[dishka]"
```

```python
from rpckit.dishka import DishkaResolver

resolver = DishkaResolver(container)
```

The adapter maps a connection to Dishka's `SESSION` scope and each RPC call to
a child scope. Supply it anywhere a rpckit resolver is accepted. For FastAPI,
prefer the router integration, which reads the root container when each socket
connects:

```python
from rpckit.dishka import dishka_router

web.include_router(dishka_router(app))
```

The integration reads `web.state.dishka_container`; pass the APP container to
`DishkaResolver` when constructing one manually. A SESSION container from
`websocket.state` is rejected because rpckit opens that scope itself and adds
`RpcConnection` and `RpcConnectedClient` to its context.

To mount endpoints with FastAPI dependencies, pass `Dishka()` as the resolver
of [`RpcRoutes`](transports.md#mount-endpoints-with-fastapi-dependencies). The
context function may then declare `FromDishka[T]` parameters without
`@inject`; they resolve from the container of Dishka's middleware, so call
`setup_dishka()` on the app:

```python
from dishka.integrations.fastapi import FromDishka

from rpckit.dishka import Dishka
from rpckit.fastapi import RpcRoutes

screencast = app.stream("/sessions/{session_id}/screencast", frames, context=Session)
events = app.socket(
    "/sessions/{session_id}/events", channels=(session_events,), context=Session
)


async def open_session(
    session_id: UUID,
    actor: AuthenticatedActor,
    sessions: FromDishka[SessionRepository],
) -> Session:
    return await sessions.get_authorized(session_id, actor)


session_routes = RpcRoutes(
    router,
    context=open_session,
    resolver=Dishka(),
    rejections={SessionNotFound: RpcRejection.NOT_FOUND},
)
session_routes.mount(screencast)
session_routes.mount(events)
```

Handlers receive the session as `Inject[Session]` and everything else from
Dishka. The context also joins Dishka's SESSION context, so providers can
receive it through `from_context`.

Dishka's FastAPI middleware from `setup_dishka()` still opens its own SESSION
container for every WebSocket, including RPC sockets. rpckit does not use
that container: RPC handlers resolve from the SESSION scope opened per
connection above, so session-scoped values are never shared between the two.
Keep RPC dependencies in the rpckit scope and do not rely on
`websocket.state.dishka_container` in RPC code.
