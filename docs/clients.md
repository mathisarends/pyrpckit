# Contract and clients

The service definition is the source of truth. pyrpckit exports it as OpenRPC,
then generates clients from that document rather than from Python internals.
The resulting artifact can therefore be reviewed, versioned, and consumed by
other tooling.

Install the generator extra:

```bash
uv add "pyrpckit[codegen]"
```

## Build a contract

```python
from pyrpckit import ServerVariable

contract = app.contract(
    title="Tasks API",
    description="Realtime task operations.",
    base_url="wss://{host}",
    variables={
        "host": ServerVariable(
            default="api.example.com",
            description="API host",
        )
    },
)
```

Endpoint paths, names, subprotocols, protocol version, typed errors, and binary
streams are derived from the service. `base_url` must be a WebSocket URL or a
URL template. Every supplied variable must occur in the resulting server URLs.

## One configuration for contract and clients

Put the importable contract in a module, then create `rpcgen.toml` beside your
project paths:

```toml
version = 1

[contract]
source = "my_api:contract"
output = "schema/tasks.openrpc.json"

[[clients]]
language = "python"
output = "src/tasks_client"
package = "tasks_client"
with_transport = "websocket"

[[clients]]
language = "typescript"
output = "frontend/src/tasks-client"
with_transport = "websocket"
```

Generate everything together:

```bash
pyrpckit generate --config rpcgen.toml
```

Paths are resolved relative to the config file. Client generation reads the
rendered OpenRPC document; it does not receive the live `RpcService` or
`RpcProtocol` object.

Run the same command in CI with `--check`. It exits nonzero and lists stale
files instead of writing them:

```bash
pyrpckit generate --config rpcgen.toml --check
```

Generated directories are owned by the generator and should not be edited by
hand.

## Generate from an existing document

The schema and client stages can also run separately:

```bash
pyrpckit schema my_api:contract \
  --output schema/tasks.openrpc.json

pyrpckit generate schema/tasks.openrpc.json \
  --language python \
  --output src/tasks_client \
  --package tasks_client \
  --with-transport websocket
```

Omit `with_transport` when integrating with an existing transport. Python
clients accept an `RpcTransport`; TypeScript clients accept the corresponding
transport interface. The OpenRPC generators are tolerant of ordinary tagged
OpenRPC methods and additionally understand pyrpckit's typed-error and binary
stream extensions.

## Use a generated client

With the generated WebSocket transport, Python exposes an async connection
context:

```python
from tasks_client import TasksClient

async with TasksClient.connect(host="api.example.com") as client:
    task = await client.tasks.create(title="Write docs")
    async for update in client.tasks.updated():
        print(update)
```

TypeScript connects explicitly and should be closed when no longer needed:

```ts
const client = await TasksClient.connect({ host: "api.example.com" });
try {
  const task = await client.tasks.create({ title: "Write docs" });
} finally {
  await client.close();
}
```

The exact client class, method arguments, endpoint names, and server variables
come from the document. See
[`examples/generated_clients`](../examples/generated_clients) for complete
generated Python and TypeScript packages.
